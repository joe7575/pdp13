### THIS MOD IS WORK IN PROGRESS!

A computer simulation that will take you back to the beginnings of programming:

- Machine code
- Telewriter
- Punch tapes
- Monitor program with assembler / disassembler (in-game)
- RAM and ROM chips to expand the computer
- Communication possibilities between computers
- Output possibilities like color lamp and 7-segment node
- Compatible to TechAge to be able control machines
- Installable assembler application `vm16asm` (on your PC)

On client side Minetest 5.4 is recommended (font=mono)

This mod is based on vm16, a virtual CPU implemented as Lua library with an outstanding performance.



### Manuals
